  Take a look at the raleigh north carolina area.   There are 3 major 
  universities here (NC State, Univ of North Carolina and Duke Univ) and a ton
  of tech & bio-medical companies.  There are also several Canonical folks
  working here.   Its called the "Triangle" because the 3 major cities  Raleigh,
  Chapel Hill and Durham are all about 20 miles from each other.   Nice place to
  live.
