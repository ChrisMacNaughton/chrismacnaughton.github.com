message: "The coronavirus pandemic has forced universities to swap to interval learning. what community service means to me essay <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>thesis helper</a> essay writing service paypal. \r\nBut what is happening today can be named an emergency delivery of content to audience members in isolation . A lot of the universities  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the transition to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University professors with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut  teachers are not required to own online learning technologies. They were simply not prepared for this, although education and its new methods are the main function of varsities. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which teachers adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it gets funny. Colleagues from regional universities said that some professors asked to write conspectuses by hand and send them scans for verification.Nowadays, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with only one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten conspectus and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they show physical exercises. Although remote physical education training can be more original, for example, you can do selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the public domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go outside anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity professors are faced with a lack of guidance and problems in dealing with organizational matters. Some of them conduct lessons on Skype, someone -in Zoom, someone only sends questions to WhatsApp. Some educators record lessons on a webcam and send them to their students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the content on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also problems with monitoring attendance. Some educators ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others require  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and difficulties, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't get an educational experience on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>global warming thesis statement</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Educators have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
