          <a href="http://uploader.chrismacnaughton.com">Uploader</a> makes sending files securely very simple.  The application allows you to upload a file and then encrypts it based on the password that you enter when uploading files and stores it securely in Amazon's S3.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you retrieve the files, the server attempts to decrypt it with your supplied password (on the download page) and then returns it to you!

          ControlVC is an application that allows users to manage many videoconferencing devices through a simple web interface.  ControlVC has since been open-sourced at <a href="https://github.com/ChrisMacNaughton/lifesize-app" target="new" rel="author">Github</a> so feel free to check it out and leave any feedback you have!

          The cities index allowed my wife and I to compare cities more effectively to determine what we were looking for in a city and what cities fit the criteria we wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because I was trying to compare so many cities at one time, I decided to use data from multiple sources to describe various cities but the primary source was the US Census API because of the data available in describing cities.
