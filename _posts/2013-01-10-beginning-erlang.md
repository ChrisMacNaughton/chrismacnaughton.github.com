[Erlang][] is my first experience with a strongly functional language. I say strongly functional because I've gotten to see a bit of functional programming in Scala through 7 Languages in 7 Weeks but Scala doesn't have to be functional; Erlang *usually* does.

While I've come from an Object Oriented background, I've enjoyed seeing and imagining what is possible with Erlang!  Possibly my favorite thing about Erlang so far is that the actor model is a basic part of the language.  Processing things concurrently is the default way to do things instead of a bolted on extra to the language that may or may not function properly.

I'm really enjoying stretching myself by learning these new and vastly different languages and really thinking about what is possible with them!
