This weekend I'm planning to attend [Houston Startup Weekend](http://houston.startupweekend.org).  It will be my first and I'm quite excited about it.

I don't have any idea that I'd like to pitch but I'm looking forward to hearing the ideas and working on making one of them happen!

##What I'm Bringing

* Laptop
* Notebook
* Pencil
* Business Cards
