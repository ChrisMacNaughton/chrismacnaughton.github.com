Last week I [wrote](/2012/11/13/startup-weekend/) about Startup Weekend and my experience starting [PermitMe](http://permitme.co).

It was written entirely in PHP.

##Moving to RoR

I decided to rebuild the entire application in Ruby on Rails to both practice my Ruby and improve the application as I was looking at rebuilding it anyway to be more object oriented and clean.

I started my rebuild on Wednesday and had the same functionality within only a few hours of working on it (spread over a few days).  Knowing the direction a project is going in does wonders for writing effective code quickly!

The site is still running the old version until I add in some user authentication and build the database of permits again (it's a lot better this time!) but soon we should be adding in new features!
