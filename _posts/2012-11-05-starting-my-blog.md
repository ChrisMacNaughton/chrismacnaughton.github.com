I'm Chris MacNaughton, a developer born and reaised in Houston, TX.  I've been programming things for years but started on the hardware side of computers, building my first when I was 12 years old.

I'm starting this blog to share my experiences, good and bad, with programming on many different scales, from simple scripts that make my life easier to the apps I'm writing that are large scale web apps integrating thousands of devices over SSH!
