The New Year is usually a time of reflection for me about what happened in the year before compared what I expected to happen as well as thinking about what might change in the coming year.

As this year wraps up, there are some major changes coming my way as I look at moving not only jobs, but city and state as well!  [Tiffany][] and I are planning on a move north; not just a little bit further north than we are, but North, as in: we could drive to Canada within a reasonable amount of time!

While this may seem like a bit of a sudden thing, we have been talking about moving for some time now and I have been on the lookout for good opportunities for me professionally so, now that I've found one, we're taking further steps to make that happen!

I've been offered a position at [eLocal][] that will allow us to move up to the Philadelphia area soon!  Additionally, it's a job more conducive to writing code and learning new things as I'm not the only developer in the entire company there!I'm really looking forward to this amazing opportunity to work with an awesome company and move to a [more family friendly place][Conshohocken]!

We've never tried moving a household before despite our experience [traveling around Europe][Eurotrip] but we're looking forward to the challenge and the new environment!  We're a bit worried about leaving our family behind but flying's very reasonable from Philadelphia (15 minute train-ride from Conshohocken) to Houston.
