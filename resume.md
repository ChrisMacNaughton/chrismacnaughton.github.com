##Background

I am a software developer interested in integrating highly disparate systems into one seamless user experience.  I enjoy learning new languages and experimenting with new features (new to me at least) to expand my knowledge.

I strive to be a quick learner and a highly capable worker.  In my free time I love reading, playing with my daughter, and learning new things.  Most recently, I started learning how to sew by trying to make a messenger bag with my wife's sewing machine.

----
##Proficiency

I have been writing code for several years now, most recently in PHP with a smattering of Ruby and Python.
